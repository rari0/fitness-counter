# Fitness Counter

This is a Fitness Counter developed for start2impact project.

## About the project

The Fitness Counter calculates the daily caloric needs of the user by collecting their data through simple selections for gender and activity level, and counters for specific data such as age and weight. The results are based on mathematical calculations sourced from <a href="https://www.my-personaltrainer.it/calcolo-calorie2.html">MyPersonalTrainer.</a><br>
During the process, users can navigate back and forth between their responses and, if necessary, repeat the test.
